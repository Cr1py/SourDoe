# SourDoe
🍞 Inspiration
Often times, women are catcalled and pestered for a Snapchat, Instagram, or their phone number. We wanted to tackle this issue by creating a resource that could help prevent further action from the initiator while getting the user out of a... crusty situation. While we were at it, we also wanted to motivate people to learn how to make sourdough bread as a way to cope from the rejection; offer a way to forget their current situation.

🥪 What it does
SourDoe is a resource that anyone can learn quickly-- essentially, it gives you a phone number that you can give to whomever may be pestering you. This phone number (using Twilio API) will send them a link to our website, where they learn how to make sourdough bread.

🍞 How we built it
We built SourDoe using Twilio API with Python and Figma to build our website. Feel free to test it out using this number: +1 (959)-214-4471
